/*
- Asynchronous Apex:
    - Apex methods that are executed in the background, and are used to perform long-running tasks, such as callouts to external services, and to avoid blocking the user interface.



    types of Asynchronous Apex:
    ---------------------------

    1- Batch Apex: 
        - Used to process large amounts of data in batches, and is used to handle complex data processing tasks, 
          such as data cleansing, data migration, and data transformation.


    2- Queueable Apex:
        - Used to perform complex data processing tasks, such as callouts to external services, and to avoid blocking the user interface.

    3- Scheduled Apex:  
        - Used to schedule Apex classes to run at specific times, such as nightly batch jobs, and to automate repetitive tasks.

    4- Future Methods:
        - Used to perform long-running tasks, such as callouts to external services, and to avoid blocking the user interface.

    5- Continuation Methods:
