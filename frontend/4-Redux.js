5- how to use redux in react?
    - create a store
    - create actions
    - create reducers
    - create a provider
    - use useSelector and useDispatch hooks

6- what is a store?
    - A store holds the whole state tree of your application.
    - The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.

7- what are actions?
    - Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.
    - They are the only source of information for the store.

8- what are reducers?
    - Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
    - Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.


9- what is dispatch?
    - Dispatch is the way you send actions to the store.

10- what is subscribe?
    - Subscribe is a method that listens to the changes in the store.

11- what is useSelector?
    - useSelector is a hook that allows you to extract data from the Redux store state.

12- what is useDispatch?
    - useDispatch is a hook that allows you to dispatch actions.

13- what is a provider?
    - The <Provider> component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need to access the Redux store.

14- what is the difference between redux and context api?
-----------------------------------------------------------
    - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
    - Context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

    - Redux is a state management library that is often used with React.
